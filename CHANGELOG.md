## [v1.3.0] (2025-06-21)

### ‚ú® What's New in v1.3.0

- **Multi-Queue Binding**:

  - Single worker can now bind to multiple queues with configurable selection strategies.
  - `WithStrategy(strategy Strategy)` configuration option for queue selection behavior.
  - Built-in strategies: RoundRobin, MaxLen and MinLen for flexible job processing patterns.

- **Function Helper Methods**:

  - `Func()`: Direct function submission for synchronous execution without return values.
  - `ErrFunc()`: Error-returning function submission with propagated error handling.
  - `ResultFunc[R]()`: Generic result-returning function submission with type-safe results.

- **Enhanced Queue Implementation**:
  - Implemented LinkedBufferQueue with dynamic, chunk-based buffer structure (up to 70% low mem uses on high load).
  - Automatic chunk management with optimized growth strategy (inspired by pond v2).

### üìä Performance Improvements

- **Memory Usage Optimization**:

  - _LinkedBufferQueue vs SliceQueue_: 62% fewer bytes allocated (82KB/op vs 217KB/op)
  - _Operation Speed_: ~46% faster queue operations (238ns/op vs 442ns/op)
  - Zero memory copy when reading across chunk boundaries

- **Reduced Allocations**:
  - Sync pool implementation for worker nodes
  - Optimized memory reuse pattern for job processing
  - Enhanced job management through controlled termination

### üìà Improvements

- **Queue Management**:

  - Improved closing behavior allowing existing items to be processed
  - Better synchronization between workers and queues

- **Worker Synchronization**:
  - Enhanced `WaitUntilFinished()` implementation with proper condition checks
  - Eliminated redundant notifications to waiting processes
  - Improved worker state management during queue transitions

### üìö Documentation Updates

- Added comprehensive benchmark comparisons and charts
- Improved API reference clarity and organization
- Enhanced README with clearer descriptions and examples
- Added documentation for multi-queue binding and function helpers

## [v1.2.0] (2025-05-29)

### ‚ú® What's New in v1.2.0

- **Dynamic Worker Pool Tuning**:
  - `worker.TunePool(concurrency int)`: Allows dynamic adjustment of the worker pool size at runtime.
- **Idle Worker Management**:
  - Configuration option `WithMinIdleWorkerRatio` for fine-grained control over the minimum ratio of idle workers.
  - Configuration option `WithIdleWorkerExpiryDuration` for setting the expiry duration of idle workers, optimizing resource usage.
- Added `worker.NumIdleWorkers()` to get the number of idle workers.
- Added `worker.NumConcurrency()` to get the current number of concurrency.

### üìä Performance Improvements

- **`Add` Operation Benchmark:**
  - _Previous Version_: 384 Bytes/operation, 8 allocations/operation
  - _Current Version (v1.2.0)_: 122 Bytes/operation, 3 allocations/operation
  - _Impact_: Approximately 68% reduction in memory usage and 62.5% reduction in allocations per operation.

### üìà Improvements

- **Pool Management**: Enhanced control over worker pool lifecycle and resource allocation with new tuning and idle management features.
- **Wait Management**: Centralized and clarified wait/stop logic on the `IWorker` interface and replaced wait group implementation by channels (`WaitUntilFinished`, `WaitAndStop`).
- **Job Management**:
  - The `Job[T]` interface, now passed to all worker functions, offers richer interaction with job data and metadata (e.g., `job.ID()`, `job.Data()`).
  - Single job can be closeable.
- **Group Job Management**:
  - Improved handling of batch operations with `EnqueuedGroupJob[T,R]` interface, providing methods like `NumPending()`, `Results()`, `Errors()` and `Wait()`

### ‚ûñ Removed Features

- **Built-in Cache**:
  - Removed `WithCache` and `WithAutoCleanupCache` configuration options. Cache management is now externalized.
- **Persistent Queue `AddAll`**:
  - The `AddAll` batch submission feature has been removed from persistent queue implementations.
- **Internal Job Management for Persistent Queues (via Cache)**:
  - With the removal of the internal cache, job state management for persistent queues relies more directly on the specific persistent adapter implementation.

### üí• Breaking Changes

This version introduces significant API changes for improved clarity, consistency, and functionality.

| `NewErrWorker[T](wf func(T) error, ...)`      | `NewErrWorker[T](wf func(j Job[T]) error, ...)`            | Worker for tasks returning only an error. Worker function now receives `Job[T]`.                                                                         |
| `queue.WaitUntilFinished()`                   | `worker.WaitUntilFinished()`                               | Responsibility for waiting for all jobs to complete moved from queue to worker.                                                                          |
